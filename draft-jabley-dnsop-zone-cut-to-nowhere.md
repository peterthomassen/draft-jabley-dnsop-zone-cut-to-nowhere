--- abstract

This document defines a standard means to signal that a zone cut
exists in the DNS without specifying a set of nameservers to which
a child zone is delegated. This is useful in situations where it
is important to make it clear to clients that a zone cut exists,
but when the child zone is only provisioned in a private DNS namespace.

# Introduction

The DNS protocol, as originally specified in {{!RFC1034}} and
{{!RFC1035}}, describes a single, global, hierarchical namespace
that is separated into zones. The boundary between a parent zone
and a child zone is indicated using a zone cut. Zone cuts are
specified using specific resource records which are published within
the parent and child zones; the parent-side resource records are
revealed during DNS resolution by way of referral responses from
nameservers.

Private DNS namespaces also exist. A user of a private network might
be able to resolve names using local DNS infrastructure that are
not visible to users of other networks. This is often an
intentional and deliberate configuration by network operators, for
example to provide name resolution for internal, private services
that are not available to users of other networks.

When a device or application uses the DNS protocol to resolve both
internal names as well as external names published in the global DNS
namespace, ambiguity can result. For example, DNS responses from
Internet-reachable nameservers might indicate that a particular
name published in an internal DNS namespace does not exist, while an
internal nameserver might be configured to respond differently.
As mobile devices attach to different networks and may cache DNS
responses obtained from different namespaces, this ambiguity can cause
headaches. For example, a DNSSEC-aware resolver on a mobile device
might cache a signed, negative response from an external nameserver
for a particular name and might treat a subsequent, positive response
from an internal nameserver for the same name as bogus, preventing
the response from being used by an application.

This document provides a means of signalling the existence of a zone
cut in a namespace in circumstances where the child zone only exists
in a DNS namespace different from that of the parent. We refer to the
associated type of delegation as a "delegation to nowhere" and
introduce the corresponding term "referral to nowhere" in
{{definitions}}.

# Conventions and Definitions {#definitions}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses DNS terminology as described in {{!RFC9499}}.
Familiarity with terms defined in that document is assumed.

This document also uses the following new terms:

1. "Delegation to nowhere" -- a delegation across a zone cut where the
child zone is not provisioned in the same DNS namespace as the parent.
A delegation to nowhere is a signal provided by the administrator of a
parent zone that a child zone exists, but is not able to be used in the
DNS namespace of the parent.
2. "Referral to nowhere", "Referral response to nowhere" -- a DNS
response received from a nameserver that reveals the existence
of a delegation to nowhere.

# Publishing a Delegation to Nowhere

A delegation to nowhere is implemented in a parent zone using a single
NS resource record with an empty target (an empty NSDNAME, in the
parlance of {{!RFC1035}}). A delegation to nowhere from the parent
zone `EXAMPLE.ORG` for the child zone `DUCKLING.EXAMPLE.ORG` with
a TTL of 3600 seconds would be described in zone file syntax as
follows:

~~~~
        ; zone data published in an external nameserver

        $ORIGIN EXAMPLE.ORG.

        ; the zone DUCKLING.EXAMPLE.ORG may exist, but in another
        ; DNS namespace

        DUCKLING  3600  IN  NS  .
~~~~

A delegation to nowhere may also be provisioned as a secure delegation.
This allows a DNSSEC-aware consumer of a referral response to obtain
and cache a DNSSEC trust anchor for the child zone, for use when
it is able to receive a signed response from a nameserver that
includes the child zone in its namespace. (This requires that the
parent administrator has knowledge of the namespace(s) in which the
child exists.)

~~~~
        $ORIGIN EXAMPLE.ORG.

        ; the signed zone PUPPY.EXAMPLE.ORG exists,
        ; but in another DNS namespace

        PUPPY  3600  IN  DS  [...]
                         NS  .
~~~~

An NS RRSet in a parent zone which includes multiple NS resource
records is not a delegation to nowhere, even if one of the NS
resource records within the RRSet has an empty target.

~~~~
        KITTEN  3600  IN  NS  A.CAT-SERVERS.EXAMPLE.
                          NS  B.CAT-SERVERS.EXAMPLE.
                          NS  .                      ; not defined here
                          NS  C.CAT-SERVERS.EXAMPLE.
~~~~

This NS RRSet does not encode a delegation to nowhere, since other
NS resource records exist in addition to the record with the empty
target (marked with a comment above). This configuration may
have some other meaning in a different context, however, and is
specifically not addressed by this specification.

# Interpreting a Referral to Nowhere

No special processing is necessary in order to interpret a referral
response to nowhere.  Individual RRSets present in a referral
response to nowhere can safely be interpreted and processed in an
identical fashion to any other referral response where the authoritative
servers for the child zone cannot themselves be resolved, and hence
cannot be reached.

This holds as long as the root does not actually resolve to an address.

[TODO] Is this guaranteed from semantic constraints?

# Applicability

When a child zone is known or presumed to exist in another namespace,
and when that other namespace is intended for use with the DNS, a
delegation to nowhere MAY be provisioned in the parent zone to signal
that the child zone exists in some other namespace. In such
circumstances the parent zone MAY be the root zone, or any other zone.

A secure delegation to nowhere MAY be provisioned if the keys used
for signing in the child zone are known to the administrator of the
parent zone. In the case where differently-signed (or unsigned)
child zones are known to exist in different namespaces, a secure
delegation SHOULD NOT be used.

Name resolution protocols other than the DNS are also used by some
systems, for names that are syntactically equivalent to domain names
in the DNS. In some cases, names resolved by those non-DNS protocols
are anchored in a specific domain that is consequently reserved in the
DNS for their use, to avoid name collisions.  Examples of such
reservations in the DNS are the `LOCAL` top-level domain, reserved
for use by Multicast DNS {{?RFC6762}}, and the `ALT` top-level domain,
reserved use in general for non-DNS resolution protocols {{?RFC9476}}.
Domains that are not intended for use with the DNS as their resolution
protocol SHOULD NOT be provisioned in the DNS as delegations to
nowhere, since there is no DNS namespace ambiguity that such a
configuration could help with.

# Examples

## Internal Namespace as a Subdomain of a Public Domain

A company uses names within the `EXAMPLE.COM` domain both for
internal services it provides to its employees and for public
services that are made available to the general public over the
Internet.

The company also provides certain services that are only available
to users of devices attached to its internal network. Those services
are named within the subdomain `CORP.EXAMPLE.COM`. The company does
not wish associated services to be visible to external users.

We say that the `EXAMPLE.COM` zone exists in the global DNS namespace
and that the `CORP.EXAMPLE.COM` zone exists only in a private DNS
namespace.

The company publishes a `CORP.EXAMPLE.COM` zone on DNS nameservers
attached to its internal network. The company configures the DNS
resolvers used by devices attached to its internal network to be
aware that the `CORP.EXAMPLE.COM` zone is served by those internal
nameservers, such that queries for names in the `CORP.EXAMPLE.COM`
domain will resolve when sent from within the company's network.

## General Purpose Top-Level Domain for Internal Namespaces

Suppose it has been decided that the top-level domain `INTERNAL` be
reserved for use in private namespaces. The root zone of the global
DNS is signed using DNSSEC {{!RFC4033}}; that is, DNSSEC-specific
RRSets are published in the root zone, allowing DNSSEC-aware
resolvers to be sure with cryptographic certainty whether particular
top-level domains exist in the public namespace.

A delegation to nowhere for the `INTERNAL` top-level domain in the
root zone of the global DNS namespace would provide an unambiguous
signal to resolvers that `INTERNAL` can exist in other namespaces only.
An insecure delegation to nowhere is appropriate in this example
since there is no known set of trust anchors that could be used to
provide a secure delegation into the multitude of namespaces that have
different, non-cooperating administrators.

~~~~
        $ORIGIN .

        ; the INTERNAL top-level domain is delegated to nowhere, to
        ; facilitate its use in private namespaces

# Updates to RFC 1035

This document updates {{Section 3.3.11 of RFC1035}} as follows:

> `NSDNAME` MAY be specified as a single, zero-length label ("empty
> `NSDNAME`"). An NS RRSet that consists of a single NS resource record
> with empty `NSDNAME` is used to indicate that a zone cut exists,
> without providing any authoritative nameservers for the child zone.
> The purpose of such an RRSet is to confirm that the child zone may
> exist, but in a DNS namespace different from that of the parent (e.g.
> in a private namespace).

# Other Uses of the Empty Name in the DNS {#other_uses}

In {{?RFC7505}} an MX resource record with an empty target (called
`EXCHANGE` in {{!RFC1035}}) is specified to mean that the corresponding
domain name does not accept e-mail. In effect, the empty field is
used to indicate that there is no host available to use for e-mail
delivery.

In {{?RFC2782}} an SRV 'Target of "." means that the service is
decidedly not available at this domain.'

{{?RFC9460, Section 2.5}} notes that 'For AliasMode SVCB RRs, a
TargetName of "." indicates that the service is not available or
does not exist.'

These uses of the empty name are conceptually consistent with the
meaning defined in this document: that using an empty name is to
be interpreted as the corresponding function not being available.

# Operational Considerations

The empty name is not known to have been widely used as an NS target,
although it has been used with other resource records, as described
in {{other_uses}}. It is a reasonable concern that if delegations
to nowhere became prevalent, or if names related to such zone cuts
were associated with significant traffic, some operational problem
might result. For example, DNS software that made incompatible
assumptions about DNS responses might fail, or harmful traffic to
root servers might result.

Some experiments carried out by the authors to assess the likelihood
of such problems are described in {{experiments}}. The results of
those experiments do not suggest that the widespread use of delegations
to nowhere would lead to operational problems.

# Security Considerations

This document provides a means for both internal and global DNS
namespaces to be provisioned using DNSSEC, allowing a DNSSEC-aware,
mobile resolver to maintain a consistent chain of trust regardless of
whether a private, child namespace exists from its particular
vantage point. The ability to support this configuration cleanly has
better security properties than configurations that are ambiguous.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

The example of the designated top-level domain `INTERNAL` being
provisioned as a delegation of `INTERNAL` to nowhere from the root
zone was intentionally chosen in order to make it clear that such
a configuration is allowed, is consistent with this specification
and facilitates the use of private DNS namespaces named under such a
top-level domain with less ambiguity than might otherwise occur.
This document does not provide any operational direction to the
IANA, however.

# Acknowledgments
{:numbered="false"}

The authors stand ready to acknowledge all contributions from their
friends and colleagues.

The phrase "delegation to nowhere" was inspired by the misremebered
title of a novel by Tim Powers entitled "Two Days to Nowhere", in
which characters deal with ambiguous realities by way of supernatural
sensitivity, time travel and alcohol.  This seemed like a good
metaphor for the problem of provisioning overlapping namespaces in
the DNS.

Unfortunately, it appears that Tim Powers wrote no such book,
although he did publish the similarly-named novel "Three Days to
Never" {{Powers2006}} which is perhaps what I (Joe) was thinking of.
And it's certainly true that much of his writing features ambiguity,
the supernatural and excessive drinking. Memory is a tricky thing.

The song "Road to Nowhere" {{Byrne1985}} from the 1985 Talking Heads
album "Little Creatures" would perhaps have been a better inspiration
for the terminology.  It's a shame that's not what happened.
